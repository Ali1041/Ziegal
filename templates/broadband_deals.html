            <h2>Why Mobile Broadband?</h2>
            <p>There are multiple reasons for using best phone broadband deals depending on the needs of a person. Mobile broadband offers a lot of flexibility. You can have your internet connection wherever you can find a mobile network signal. You can take it along with you while traveling and any outdoor locations without worrying about internet availability.</p>
            <img src="{% static 'imgs/bb1.PNG' %}" alt="">
            <p>One of its major advantage is for users who live in remote areas of the UK where a fixed line or regular broadband connection has limited access. Even in remote areas where the fixed line is available, it offers very slow internet speed as homes may be located at long distances from the nearest exchange. But, if these places are covered by 4G mobile networks, mobile broadband can offer quicker and more consistent speeds than an ADSL connection.</p>
            <h3>THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING MOBILE BROADBAND DEAL</h3>
            <p>However, there are a few things to keep in mind if you're thinking to buy a mobile broadband deal. First, you have to keep in mind that signals of the network may not be available at your home or location where you require the internet. You should check the coverage area of the network. If your mobile sim is not having good signals and you have trouble in making calls then mobile broadband for that network will not work well.</p>
            <p>Second, in the UK fixed-line contracts are cheaper and come with unlimited internet usage deals. While mobile broadband connections are expensive as compared to fixed-line contracts and have fewer data available in cheaper deals.</p>
            <p>Third, not all mobile broadband deals have same speed. First you should select the network providing the fastest mobile broadband connection. Than you have to select deal which matches your requirement. 3G deals are slowest of all, 4G deals are faster than 3G and 5G is faster than both 3G and 4G networks. But 5G has limited access in UK and you have to confirm the coverage of your area.</p>
