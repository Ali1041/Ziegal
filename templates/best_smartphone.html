                                          <p>To further help you in making a choice of the best Smartphone between Android and iPhone, it is important to dwell on few of the pros and cons mentioned above.<br><strong></strong></p>
                                          <p><strong>Hardware: Android vs iPhone</strong></p>
                                          <p>As far as hardware is concerned, it is easier to make a choice with iPhone than an Android phone. This is because Apple sells just three to four models per time. The screen sizes of iPhone range from 4in (iPhone SE) to 4.7in (iPhone 7), and 5.5in (iPhone 7 Plus). There is also the new iPhone 8 which comes with a 5.8in screen. The average price range of iPhone is between £379 and £699.</p>
                                          <p>The Android phones on the other hand have a wide range of brands that it might be quite difficult to choose the best Smartphone among the multitude. Some of the known brands of Android phones are Sony and Samsung. However, there are a host of other brands competing in the Android phones space. The prices of <a href="https://www.ziegal.co.uk/" title="android mobile phones">Android phones </a>range between £50 and £800.</p>
                                          <p>The next logical question will be; are iPhone the best Smartphone options when compared to Android phones? The answer is No! There are some Android mobile phones that have better cameras, higher resolution screens, or extra amazing features than what are available with iPhone devices.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Software: Android vs iPhone</strong></p>
                                          <p>Choosing between an iOS and Android operating system is also a matter of preference. There are many people who consider the iOS as the best Smartphone and there are others who think the Android is. The iPhone for instance has all its apps on multiple home screens and do not offer the option of customization. The Android on the other hand offers the option to do whatever you like with your home screen and display.</p>
                                          <p>There are many things that distinguish the Android phones from iPhones but the fact is that they both have their distinctive attractions. Choosing the best Smartphone therefore is really a matter of preference</p></div>
